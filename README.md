# One-Click Miner

The One-Click Miner allows cryptocurrency enthusiasts to get into mining with minimal effort. When you download the One-Click Miner, you will be asked to provide a password for your (built in) wallet. It will then immediately commence mining.

This is a redevelopment of Vertcoin's [One Click Miner](https://github.com/vertcoin-project/one-click-miner).

This software is available for Windows and Linux.
